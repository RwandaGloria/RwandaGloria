# Welcome! 👋🏽

Hey, I’m Gloria. I build backend systems that **actually serve people**, not just meet technical specs.

Let’s cut to the chase: You’re not here to read a novel. You want to know if I can solve problems, ship product, and bring value. The answer? ✅

I'm a backend developer with nearly **3 years** of hands-on experience — not just pushing code, but **building things that people use**.

## 🌍 A Bit About Me

Half Thai, half Nigerian — I bring global perspective, scrappy energy, and a no-BS approach to development. I specialize in building **real-world solutions** that connect businesses with their users. From automation to AI to APIs, I work fast, think deeply, and deliver.

My core stack is **Node.js (Express)** with a touch of **C#**, but the truth? Tools change. What matters is knowing how to use them to build things that work.

## 🚀 Projects That Matter

### 🔮 [Exideus Avatars](https://www.extended-kastel-academy.com)

Imagine being on a call and actually understanding how someone *feels* — not just what they’re saying. That’s what we built.

**Exideus** is an emotionally intelligent, real-time AI video avatar platform. It’s not just about talking to an AI — it’s about reading emotions, behavior, and intent. The real magic? The *insights*.

**Tech I used:**
- 🧠 **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for smart, context-aware responses  
- 🔁 **n8n** to automate workflows, data handling, and AI integration  
- ☁️ **AWS** for deployment & scaling  
- 🛠 **Sentry** for error tracking and debugging  
- 🗣 **11Labs** for lifelike voice generation  
- 🎙 **Retell AI** for real-time voice agent interactions

### 🎯 [Gallmond Recruiting Platform](https://services.gallmond.com/tech-jobs-finden)

Built a smart recruiting platform that doesn’t just *connect people* — it actually understands them.

Here’s how it works: After a recruiter or candidate finishes a call, the platform analyzes the conversation and automatically surfaces relevant job opportunities from the company’s database. Based on what was said in the call, it recommends matching roles — turning every interaction into a high-quality placement opportunity.

**It’s not just a job board — it’s intelligent matchmaking.**

**What I did:**
- Engineered post-call logic that dynamically recommends jobs based on conversation context  
- Built backend flows to connect call data with company databases in real time  
- Streamlined recruiter-candidate matching into one seamless experience  


### 👩‍🏫 [Beautiful Teachers](https://www.beautifulteachers.com/)

We connected Portuguese-speaking students with English teachers — but here's the twist: **we automated everything**.

No back-and-forth DMs. No scheduling chaos. Just click, book, and learn.

**What I did:**
- Used **n8n** to translate teacher profiles and streamline backend flows  
- Developed custom **API routes** for clean and scalable logic  
- Built an **interactive voice agent** using **11Labs** + **Retell**  
- Helped connect the platform to **GHL (GoHighLevel)** for CRM and customer workflows

### 🏗 [UseBnkle](https://www.buildwithbnkle.com/)

Construction project management made simple. Bnkle helps contractors, vendors, and clients across the U.S. and Africa streamline every part of the build process — from bids to quality control.

**My contributions:**
- Designed and built secure API routes (CRUD, auth, access control)  
- Interpreted UI/UX to build backend logic that *actually supports users*  
- Collaborated via **pair programming** with frontend and backend teams

### 🗣 [Echoes to Symphony](https://flint-saber-streetcar.glitch.me/)

A coach wanted a simple, elegant site to help people speak more clearly. I built it with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — nothing fancy, just clean, functional, and fast.

---

### 🍲 [Food Baskett](https://foodbaskett.app/)

Built and deployed **serverless functions** for a food ordering system in Nigeria. Worked closely with product and frontend teams, integrated systems, wrote clean code, and made sure everything ran smooth. Because performance matters.

---

### 🤖 [Telegram Chatbot](https://t.me/Exp_Buddy_bot)

An open-source side project: Buy data bundles and top up wallets — all inside Telegram.

Why? Because Meta’s WhatsApp API is expensive. Built this as a lean alternative. Integrated **Paystack** for payments, used **MongoDB** for storage, and secured it like a vault.

---

### 📺 [Gentle Storm Entertainment](https://gentlestorment.com)

An OTT (video streaming) platform that rewards users for watching content. Built both **frontend and backend** with **Vanilla JS + TypeScript**. Still in progress — but already doing work that drives results.

---

### 🔗 [URL Shortener](https://mylinks-f6107.web.app)

Collaborated on a clean, fast, open-source URL shortener. Wrote the backend logic in **Node.js**, used **MongoDB**, and kept the codebase simple and maintainable.

---

### 💬 [WhatsApp Chatbot](https://wa.link/6fs2f2)

Built a WhatsApp chatbot that helps Nigerians buy data bundles. Integrated with **VTU APIs** and **WhatsApp Cloud API**. Real users. Real use. Real value.

## 🎯 Bonus: Growth Hacking + Dev = 💰

Before I was in tech, I was in **marketing + growth hacking** — and that still shows up in how I build. I don't just write code that works. I write code that **moves the needle**.

I think like a builder *and* a strategist. That’s my edge.
